### Juna IT Poll

Wordpress Plugin is an instrument for understanding visitor 's opinions. You can use this plugin for explaining  what your users think about your web-page or  a new page and or about  any question. 
We believe that researching is an  importing instrument in each web-site but more attractive side is the visitor can vote only  once, not leting him/her vote the same question any more not breaking the real result of the inquiry. And  THE other adventages you will feel after using Plugin. It's better to use one time than read a lot without seeing the real images. 

Juna IT Poll lets you  add standart and social questions in your profile easily. We have done all the best to help Wordpress users to create inquiries easier and quickly. THERE are Poll Plugin  4 
variants in our Poll Plugin, which are necessary for each profile/web-site. And it will be improved for you every time and will also  
increase the variants of the questions . You can rule any question and answer.
